# Semantic Search Engine

This project is a semantic search engine using Elasticsearch and OpenAI to index and search for books. It leverages embeddings generated by OpenAI to enhance the relevance of search results.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
- An `.env` file containing your OpenAI API key.

## Configuration

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aurelienbono/Semantic-Book-Search-Engine
   cd Semantic-Book-Search-Engine
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create an `.env` file at the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key:

   ```env
   OPEN_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   Python dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and will be installed automatically during the Docker image build.

## Execution

1. **Build and run Docker containers:**

   Use Docker Compose to build and run the Elasticsearch and Python application services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This will build the Docker image for your application and start the containers for Elasticsearch and your application.

2. **Access the application:**

   Once the containers are running, you can access the application via `http://localhost:8000`.

## Features

- **Book Indexing:** Books are indexed in Elasticsearch with embeddings generated by OpenAI.
- **Semantic Search:** Perform searches based on the semantic similarity of embeddings.
- **Recommendation Refinement:** Uses an LLM to refine book recommendations based on the user's query.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main entry point of the application.
